# ffxiv-shimmering-fix
This details how to reduce the "Band of shimmer" you sometimes see when walking on sharpened texture surfaces on FFXIV, which also sometimes lowers FPS. **NOTE: This fix only works for NVidia cards** I'm sorry.

I had to hunt down for an alternative download link and as you can guess, the UI is a little different now.

I also prefer hosting these guides here where they will not be archived, and can have changes made to them in future.


# **Pre-requisites**
Download NVidia profile inspector (not nvidia inspector) from [here](https://github.com/Orbmu2k/nvidiaProfileInspector/releases/latest)
Extract it somewhere you'd like to keep it (It's a portable application, not an installer) and run it.

# **What to change**
You've run the application, and you're now greeted with this screen

Up the top you'll se a profile select drop-down menu, use it to select Final Fantasy XIV (You can also type in Final Fantasy)

You'll then want to change the following two settings. DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING ELSE IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY MEAN.

Now you can save your profile

Close the application and enjoy your game.
